# The-ULTIMATE-Skyblock-Mod-Folder
A new Unofficial Hypixel Skyblock Mod Folder

Note that you will need forge for all of these mods. To download forge go and get the latest version of java or any and go and download forge unviveral jar/installer
Then put the mods into the mod folder. Where is the mod folder? For windows go and press WIN + R or just search in start "Run" Then put the mods in. For a simpler way and for mac go into the launcher then edit then press on the button to go to .minecraft


Another Note that all of these mods are not supported by hypixel or me. If you want to download the mods by your own or not risking downloading this zip file (It's safe) Go to the websites below
